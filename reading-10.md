JS ch10: Intro to graceful error handling with "try, catch, throw and finally" used for error handling used when trying to 
request data from a third party.
No entry sign to clear variables in console was nice to learn about, I was having trouble when retrying to redefine variables in the past.
Console.table() for nice display of objects in console. Console.assert(condition) to only write to console if 'condition' evaluates to false.
Console->Sources to see js code and and add breakpoints to stop at any line and step through commands if using multiple breakpoints look valuable. Looks same as 'debugger' but in console.
