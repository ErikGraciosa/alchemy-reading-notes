JS ch10: Intro to graceful error handling with "try, catch, throw and finally" used for error handling used when trying to 
request data from a third party.
No entry sign to clear variables in console was nice to learn about, I was having trouble when retrying to redefine variables in the past.
Console.table() for nice display of objects in console. Console.assert(condition) to only write to console if 'condition' evaluates to false.
Console->Sources to see js code and and add breakpoints to stop at any line and step through commands if using multiple breakpoints look valuable. Looks same as 'debugger' but in console.

CSS ch8: Using alt="" in an image tag looks like a simpler way for small text vs the CSS background image, probably only use for simple static text though. Gradually gaining experience with the different tags but still learning about the different specific styles some of them have. For instance in the firday lab we were trying to center the header tag in the page but having difficulties, I think we could have just placed a div one level lower and just center the div to get a good centered appearance then just let the header span the entire page.
