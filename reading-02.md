## Journal Entry 2

### CSS/HTML Chapter 2, 10

CSS/HTML Chapter 2: This chapter was heavy in definitions and reference, it was nice to have some description about intent of specific tags and the appearance on page.  There was a very slight mention of CMS and dreamweaver, which seemed outdated but looks like the book is from 2014 so probably more relevant then. 

CSS/HTML Chapter 10: Style in html was introduced(seems like this is a bad practice), and curious what level of precedent style in html would take over the CSS sheet, seems like highest. There is more CSS logic that can be used to widely control tags. The book showed examples of using the same tag at multiple locations for different attributes which seemed slopping to me.
### JS Chapter 2 and 4(up to switch section)
JS Chapter 2: Good review of the building blocks, the different data types, review of order of operations and string operators. The loosely defined variables is new to me and a bit weird to unlearn, typeOf will be my friend.

JS Chapter 10: Planning! Using a flow chart to plan out logic prior to writing code is a nice blueprint to work towards vs exploring while writing code. Learned the === checks datatypes and comparisons don't have to be in parenthesis. Logical not(!) is available but not sure best use case versus changing the conditional.
