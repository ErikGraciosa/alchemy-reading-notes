Atomic Design:
"Break down until can't be broken down any further"
"For components to be reusable and composable, you have to make them as small and as independent as possible"
-Highlighting the different appearances with the same breakdown of components that could have different style tags. Showing each frame, content, icon, title, etc but different size/style. 
1:1 approach of each component matches one piece of the data model

JS Callbacks:
-"Callbacks are a way to make sure certain code doesn’t execute until other code has already finished execution".
-A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument.
-First class function is when functions can be treated like variables. assigned, returned, passed into functions.

Classes: 
- the first article felt like code barf,
- the second article does better from a 101 approach at first then feels like code barf,
-mostly I'm taking away that classes are used to build objects as constructors and not object literals but not entirely sure that is a correct statement.
-Not really sure what a class is used for after reading these articles beyond the dictionary definition in the second article “a set or category of things having some property or attribute in common and differentiated from others by kind, type, or quality.”
-"this" is going to take some time to sink it, it is a difficult word to use when the word "this" does not have a direct meaning since it is a reference to context.
