Reading notes HTML Ch6: Review of the structure using <table>, <th> table header, <tr> table row, <td> table data. <tfoot> was introduced but
always at the bottom of the table. I'm curious if this will always go to the bottom of the table or if required to be last in html and mostly used for styling.

JS Ch3: Methods are the same as function but inside of an object. It is possible to return multiple values out of a function using an array,
otherwise still only one value can be returned. Using "iffy" functions to protect variables inside functions seems like something to use when
collaborating with others. Constructor notation was something new and .this was confusing. The .this concept helped with more explanation in
the last section of the chapter but will need some practice on this one.

The article I was mostly trying to figure out constructor notation to
follow the examples. I mostly saw the article as thinking about the main inputs and the main outputs and what happens in the function the dev
will have control of but once inputs and outputs get agreed upon outside of the dev's domain the input and outputs will be harder to change.
