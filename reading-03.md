## Journal Entry 3

CSS/HTML Chapter 2: Definition lists are the new tag i'll have to try out as well as the nested list that changes bullet type.

Chapter 13: All about boxes, new borders to play with and color control of each side. Forcing block/inline w display looks like a workaround. Even more borders and how to round shapes looks like it can get as complex as you want to write it. Lots of control in CSS but is seems like is could get sloppy without a plan.

JS Chapter 2 small section on arrays, all variable types can be in an array, and arrays are useful when having a list of values related to each other. Allay literal, listed out values to create array in square brackets, then can call element by index.Â 

Chapter 4 >switch section: Switch statement used when there is a large number of states. Can call by element. More truthy falsy was good to see as well as a reference chart since I haven't practiced truthy falsy much. Break/continue concepts where introduced. Also a warning to avoid variable definition in loops if the variable will never change to avoid slowing the page load. += will append a string with previous contents and new, useful in loop to keep adding on.
