Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime. Node is behind the npm package manager. 
Able to install packages locally.
Node used to install and run various build tools, designed to automate the process of developing a modern Javascript application.
Node.js allows javascript to run on a server.
Event-driven.
Ah, the event loop, seems like it is now of concern with async and await.
Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration.
