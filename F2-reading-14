Gender gap in tech - Article points to video game advertising leading to gender gap in computer-science degrees in the 80's. I thought the article was good at presenting examples and also curious what else would have contributed to the later downward trend of women pursuing comp-sci degrees. Kinda surprised that the example image was Qbert instead of some sort of poster of hyper masculinity and damsel in distress. 


Website shows demographic stats of company employees. Good to see where it stands would be curious about changes in the last ten years or also have where STEM/compsci degree diversity is to project a cascade.


Last article of how/why to push for diversity, article presents benefits of diversity to a business with efficiency/productivity/financial measurements.
