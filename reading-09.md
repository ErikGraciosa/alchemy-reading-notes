HTML Ch7: All about forms, and when to use each tag, I ended up using fieldset in the lab and it turned out ok but still had to wrap it in a form tag
that wasn't apparent in the book to get my submit button working. The validation fields looked good but I didn't end up implementing them in the lab.

HTML Ch 12: "list-style" in CSS looks like the go to for ul bullet styles. Nice reference for styling and how to align. What I really want to know
is how is an auto save implemented to bring back data entered when I accidentally hit the back button and navigate away from page but just had a 500 word
cover letter I didn't save else where?

JS: The ending example was a tough follow since it was a single image and text describing what would happen, would be nice to have how the image
stepped along based on interaction. We've been using DOM level 2 event listeners that take 3 arguments but we have only been sending the first two.
The third is a boolean controlling event flow, bubble vs capture.

Where is the demo website that has the full walk through of each event listener? Like the baby toy for sorting shapes, anyone know if it exists?
