## Journal Entry 1

### Chapters 1, 8, 17, 18 HTML/CSS
From my notes I found HTML chapter 1 to be good at the introducing some tags and a good reference to vocabulary/nomenclature when trying to implement semantic html., would have been better to get a full list of the semantic tags though. Chapter 8 was good to introduce the commenting syntax and add id/class to group html element; the concept of global attributes was good to theme a page versus specific tags; the concept of block versus inline elements was reinforced. Chapter 17 furthered the semantic html structure and avoidance of div soup, and introduced the why of screen readers and search engines using specific tags; the design and "flow of the page" was reiterated and accounting for appearance on older browsers and how to account or older browsers was mentioned. Chapter 18 then built up the process and design characteristics of a webpage and focused on the designer to ask themselves "what the users of the website would be coming to the website to do?". The pre-work of creating user-scenarios was introduced and to design based on those user-scenarios and user perception. Wireframing and grouping of like elements and how to emphasis was covered. 

Overall these chapters focused on structure and design from the basics to more advanced and emphasis the need for a plan and for the design to ask why and have intent when placing content. For me, the reading and time spent in recent labs highlight that I should wireframe first before placing any html elements.

### Chapter 1 JS
In the JS book, the biggest take away was to have a plan on how to solve the problem/interpret data/inputs and to break down into small steps to achieve end goal. Planning, planning, planning.
