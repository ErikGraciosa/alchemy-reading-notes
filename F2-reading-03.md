RWD:Responsive to adapt to multiple viewport sizes. Adaptive, being reconfigured to fit specific viewports. Mobile, build a separate specific page. Design to dynamically adapt has most ROI and uses flexible layouts, media queries and flexible media. Stick to relative dimensioning for size adjustments.
New unit to try:
vw
Viewports width
vh
Viewports height
vmin
Minimum of the viewport’s height and width
vmax
Maximum of the viewport’s height and width

@ media to query screen size

Floats:
Float used to wrap text around an image and irregular shapes. Can be used in layout but grid and flex better. Enables alignment to reflow when other elements resized. If every child in a parent is floated the parent will collapse to zero in size, the parent would need a static child element for the other elements to float to.
Floats have to be cleared.
