HTML Ch5: Good practice to dedicate a folder to images, and use images matching height/width of block to avoid negative resizing issues. <img> is inline unless a block element immediately follows. <figure> with <img> and <figcaption> inside is good to keep a caption with an image.

Ch11: Colors able to be called using, RGB/RGBA, hexcodes, colors names, and hsl/hsla. Keep contrast in mind when selecting.

Ch12: Keep in mind fonts need to be installed on user computers to display. There can be differences between PC/mac. An "em" is the measurement of the width of "m". Sizes are in pt, px, %, ems. use @font-face to allow use of a font not installed on a user computer. There are some display workaround to still have text supplied to screen readers or search engines but not be displayed on page.
