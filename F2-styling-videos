You'll be able to watch the videos at 1.25 or 1.5 speed and still get most of it. Uses some tag/class CSS.

-conditional styling!
-custom radio buttons
-custom checkboxes

-good introduction of the topics starting with baseline form and final product form shown. 
-presenter uses a for/id in CSS using a label but I thought we could just keep the input in the label tags and acomplish the same thing.
-spans after check boxes for image check to appear later

For radio buttons
-set opacity to zero, width zero, height zero
-use own images, 1 image for all the image styles but styling different positions of the image
-conditional styling for when checked for moving position of the image being displayed. based on psuedoclass "checked".

For checkboxes
-mostly the same thing as radios

Background images on text inputs
-just use background property to set an image.
-has a sprite that has multiple images and check position based on conditional property

Explains how to remove default properties that browsers and to dropdown.

Shadow on a black background...ok.

Validations
-using "valid" psuedoclass for when input contains valid data to apply styles. Always a nice quality of life feature for users to avoid red *'s.
