-custom radios
-custom checkboxes

-cool start of baseline to final product 
for/id using a label but I thought we could just just keep the input in the label tags and acomplish the same thing.
-spans after check boxes for image check to appear later

For radio buttons
-set opacity to zero, width zero, height zero
-use own images, 1 image for all the image styles but styling different positions of the image
-conditional styling for when checked for moving position of the image being displayed. based on psuedoclass "checked".
