google team building- case study, Julia, 25, some work experience, enrolled to Yale MBA with program focused to foster tight bonds but that team was high stress due to being overly competitive. Julia liked reduced judgement team better than study group team.-Initially a bunch of google assumptions of good practices but not proven. Article repeated how often outside of work employees communicated.Â But couldn't find strong correlation.- Group norms mattered, which ones for productivity?Collective IQs?In the end, equal speaking time, average social intuition of memebers, psychological safety mattered, over all "In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs."
