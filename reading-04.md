HTML Ch4: All about links. Using <a> tag to link to outside pages and also local pages in file directory using terminal-esque syntax. Cool to see also can link to other locations in the present page.

Ch15: Appreciated the diagrams that show tags and appearance side by side. Many examples of good layouts I'll try to mimic in the labs, also saw recommended to keep page widths at 960-1000px to fit most screens. The twelve column grid was a cool concept. I can see myself already mentally overlaying this on everything now and seeing it everywhere.

JS Ch3: A very dense chapter on functions. Big take away as using a function to store actions to be called later so that page doesn't have to load everything in the function except when called. Anonymous functions seem more like a way to place notes to future readers that input and output are about to happen. Variable scope was good to go over as well as the pitfalls of global/local scope and naming collisions.
